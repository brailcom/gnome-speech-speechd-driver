The Requirements:
=================

You will need these components to compile Speech Dispatcher:  
 - glib 2.0  (http://www.gtk.org)
 - bonobo-activation-2.0 >= 0.9.1 (http://www.gnome.org/)
 - libbonobo-2.0 >= 1.97.0 (http://www.gnome.org/)
 - ORBit-2.0 >= 2.3.94 (http://www.gnome.org)
 - gnome-speech-1.0 >= 0.8 (http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/)

Only if you are building from CVS, you also need these:
 - automake 1.7+, autoconf, pkg-config and libtool

We recommend to also install these packages:
 - Gnopernicus (http://www.baum.ro/gnopernicus.html)
 - Festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/)

Building Speech Dispatcher Driver:
==================================

(for instructions about how to build from CVS or CVS snapshot see bellow)

First unzip the distribution tarball where this file is located

 $ tar -xzvf gnome-speech-speechd-driver-@VERSION.tar.gz
 $ cd gnome-speech-speechd-driver-@VERSION

Configure the driver and it's installation parameters by running

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/

Warning: Without specifying the above prefix option, the default instalation of
Gnopernicus will not find the module. Change it only if you know what you are
doing.

On some systems, before running make, you have to set the environment variable
SED to your binary of the sed application. This is usually done as:
 $ export SED=sed

Then you can proceed

 $ make all

If everything worked ok, you can install all the parts to the default
path by running (as root):

 $ make install

Now after you restart Gnome Speech (this likely means logging out and in of
your X session), it should be possible to use Gnome Speech and Gnopernicus with
Speech Dispatcher. In Gnopernicus, the appropriate settings are located under
the menus Settings/Speech/Voices/.

If you like to set specific Speech Dispatcher defaults for connections comming
from Gnome Speech, you can create a client specific configuration section in
speechd.conf, as described in Speech Dispatcher's documentation. The
identification for Gnome Speech connections is gnome-speech:main:USERNAME where
USERNAME stands for the name of the logged in user running Gnopernicus. Usually,your mask will thus be just "*gnome-speech*".

If it doesn't work, please see "Building from CVS" if this is your case. If
not, you can ask us on users@lists.freebsoft.org or report possible bugs on
speechd@bugs.freebsoft.org .

Building from CVS
=================

If you are building directly from CVS or from some CVS tarball snapshot, you
must first create the ./configure file. Please make sure you have all the
necessary tools listed in the requirements at the beginning of this README
in their appropriate versions. Automake and autoconf are especially version
sensitive.

Then please do:

 $ ./build.sh

in the source directory just before running ./configure.

Now the ./configure file should be created and you can proceed like with
an ordinary instalation.


Building in more detail:
========================

The hierarchy of Makefiles is used to build each of the parts. The top
level Makefile allows you to compile some extra parts of the project.
These are:

    - doc ........ build documentation in all supported formats
                   (see doc/README for more information)
    - src/server ..... build speachd server - this is the same as
                   cd src/server; make all
    - src/modules .... build all speachd modules - this is the same as
                   cd src/modules; make all
    - src/clients .... build all clients - this is the same as
                   cd src/clients; make all
    - clean ...... remove all files except the sources (does not
                   clean documentation)
    - all ........ build server, modules and clients
